If we are going with a schizophrenia theme:

(theses are all just ideas)

1. implement a sanity function. Higher chances of "episodes" happening. 
	the lower the sanity the riskier it is for the player

2. Continuing on the sanity function; implement an entity that can chase the player if sanity is too low. 

3. The goal should be escaping somewhere (can be a forest, house, ect.)

4. Implement a field of vision; the player can only see what's in their fov. 
	Maybe have the mouse dictate where the player is looking. Anything
	outside of the player's fov is blurred and some objects and entites
	are invisible. 
			      ^
these are just game mechanics |
